# For Admins

Running the server takes a lot of time. If you help me with doing some basic moderating stuff, I can allocate more of my time to the technical side of running the server ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Minecraft Commands

### CoreProtect logs

If somebody wants to cheat they will always find a way. However, x-ray is the first and easiest cheat they will try to use. Therefore, we can more easily filter out new players by having anti-x-ray intentionally disabled and checking on them once in a while. It's really easy to do and fun detective work too üòä

- Go in spectator with `/gm 3`. Run the command below. Click on the coords to teleport to the location.
    ```
    /co l u:USER t:30d b:deepslate_diamond_ore
    ```
- `/co l u:USER t:30d b:deepslate_diamond_ore r:20`\
Radius check.
- `/co i`\
More [here](./Features/coreprotect.md).

- `/spectate PLAYER`
- `/spectate leave`
