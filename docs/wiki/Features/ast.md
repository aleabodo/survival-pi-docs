# Armor Stand Tools

On this server you can modify armor stands to a great extent. You can move it, rotate it, move limbs, add armor, resize it, make it invulnerable and more. This is how you do it:

1. Build an amor stand.
2. Stand next to the armor stand and look at it. Run the command `/ast` to open the Armor Stand Tools menu. 
3. This GUI menu lets you modify everything about the armor stand. Some features, like spawning, are disabled to fit in better with the Survival gameplay. I recommend watching [this tutorial video (8:30)](pathname://https://youtu.be/x0a11Dpc4Ng?si=DFgwVKvJ2jpDZk-r&t=514) to learn how to use the feature.
4. When you're done modifying run `/ast` again to close the menu. 

:::info[Tip]
Make sure to make it invulnerable after you're done making your character if you don't want players to accidentally punch it.
