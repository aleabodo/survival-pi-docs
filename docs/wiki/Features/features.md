# Features

- `/spawn`: Teleports you to Spawn.
- `/home`: Teleports you to your home. Set your home with `/sethome`. There is a one hour cooldown on the command.
- `/s`: Survival-friendly Spectator mode. You cannot pass through blocks, use it for x-ray, and it doesn't allow you to leave a certain radius.
- `/pvp`: Toggle PvP.
- `/co i`: Hold a block in your hand then run the command. This command toggles into an inspection mode.  With left- and right-click you can inspect the history of every block and see every player that has interacted with it. Run the command again to leave the inspection mode. All interactions are logged for two months.
- **Dynmap marker**: You can create a maker on the [Dynmap](pathname://https://map.survival-pi.com/) by building a sign and adding `[dynmap]` in the first line. The rest of the lines will show up as the marker text on the Dynmap website. 
- **Sitting**: Right-click with your empty fist on any stair or slab to sit on it. Press *SHIFT* to stand up again.
- **Riding player**: You can ride on the back of a player by right-clicking them with your empty fist.
- **Custom music discs**: We have custom music discs collectibles that you can win from the vote crate (vote with `/vote`). In order to hear the custom music, you need to have the [voice chat mod](./vc.md) enabled. You can adjust the volume of the music discs in the voice chat settings (`v`).
